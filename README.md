TECHNICAL DETAILS
Methods and Qualifications Used
PyGame library was used in the project. PyGame is a popular Python library used to develop 2D games. Additionally, PIL (Python Imaging Library) was used for graphics operations. The music and sound effects used in the game were managed with PyGame's mixer module. Since the game-specific backgrounds (pixel art soft color design) files created by the artificial intelligence that made the Stabble Diffusion visual design are in WEBP File (.webp) format, the conflict problem was solved by using the pillow library to convert them into the pygame library. Two different fonts were used to develop the game graphically.
